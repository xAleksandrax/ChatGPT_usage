# Why Chat GPT
The decision to utilize ChatGPT for generating the summary of the diploma thesis stems from the model's proficiency in crafting coherent and comprehensible content. ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to grasp the essence of complex information and provide a clear summary, which is crucial for the purposes of a diploma thesis. The choice of this tool is based on the belief that ChatGPT will enable the creation of a unique and yet pertinent summary, preserving the originality of the work.

# Usage
The generated summary serves a crucial role in my diploma thesis titled 'Information Extraction System from PDF Documents: Automating Structural Data Analysis.' The thesis focuses on developing a Python-based tool for extracting information from various types of PDF documents, including invoices, contracts, and reports. The tool utilizes web scraping techniques to automatically retrieve data from these documents. The summary, crafted with the assistance of ChatGPT, will be instrumental in providing a concise and insightful overview of the research, methodology, and key outcomes of this project. It will serve as a comprehensive introduction for readers, offering a clear understanding of the significance and objectives of the developed information extraction system.

# Generated text
Information Extraction (IE) constitutes one branch of the broader field of Data Mining. Its aim is the automatic extraction of specified information from unstructured data, which lacks a predefined format or content template. IE tasks encompass diverse data types and leverage various artificial intelligence algorithms. However, precise definition of the information domain being sought is crucial. Accurately described data can be stored in a knowledge repository, typically in the form of a database, enabling further data exploration.

Primary tasks in text-based information extraction include named entity extraction, entity type recognition, coreference resolution, relation discovery, extraction from semi-structured data, and linguistic and lexical analysis. These tasks often require processing written text by humans, and various Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods are commonly employed for this purpose.

This work focuses on information extraction from homepages of scientific conferences, represented in the form of HTML documents. These pages are textual documents, but their structure does not store information in a straightforwardly structured manner. The work addresses the extraction of information such as conference name, location, duration, and other important dates. This task falls under the category of Entity Type Recognition.

The objective of this study was to create a classifier capable of extracting information from the homepages of scientific conferences. The main focus was on two classifier models: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Real homepages of scientific conferences were utilized as the training and testing dataset to obtain representative results.

The subsequent sections of the paper present the theoretical foundations of the employed algorithms, describe the specifics of the analyzed problem, detail the practical implementation of the task, and conduct an analysis of the obtained results. The paper is divided into four main sections covering the explanation of algorithm functionality, description of the analyzed subject, practical aspects of task implementation, and result analysis.

Added value is provided through the analysis of the characteristics of homepages from various scientific conferences, offering statistical insights into the features of the training dataset. Subsequently, the creation of the information extraction classifier is described, focusing on document tokenization, attribute preparation, model training, and inference. The study compares different classifier models, with particular emphasis on the Paired Conditional Random Fields Model. In conclusion, the paper presents research results, draws conclusions, and suggests possibilities for further developments in the field of information extraction from unstructured data.

# Potential issues
In the context of generating summaries using the ChatGPT tool, several potential issues and drawbacks can be identified compared to other models or tools:

1.Contextual Understanding Limitations: ChatGPT may struggle with fully grasping the context of longer text segments, leading to imprecise or incomplete summaries. Other models might be more advanced in analyzing long-term dependencies in the text.

2.Tendency to Replicate Information: Similar to other machine learning-based models, ChatGPT might have a tendency to replicate certain phrases or information, resulting in redundancy in the summary. Other models may be more effective in eliminating such repetitions.

3.Lack of Control Over Text Style: ChatGPT may generate text in various styles, which could be undesirable in the context of summarizing scientific work. Other tools might offer better control over the style of the output text.
